### Two Pointers

Common pattern for solving problems involving arrays or linked lists. It involves maintaining two pointers, which can either move in the same direction or in opposite directions, based on the requirements.

#### Two common scenarios are:

1. **Same Direction**: In problems like finding a subarray sum or linked list cycle detection, two pointers (slow and fast) move in the same direction but at different speeds.
2. **Opposite Direction**: In problems like finding a pair of elements with a given sum in a sorted array, two pointers start at opposite ends of the array and move towards each other.

The two pointer technique can help reduce time complexity in problems that would otherwise require nested iterations. It's a powerful tool for solving array and linked list problems, especially when the data is ordered or when you're asked to find a pair of elements that meet certain criteria.
